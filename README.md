# Neo4j Flights Planner
This repository contains part of a project developed for the Information Retrieval course of the University of Oviedo. The aim of the project is to use Neo4j and the Cypher language to model a real life domain. In my case, I will try to model the flight system.
You can find the datasets used to create the database in the datasets folder, and in the simple_demo folder you can find the source code of a simple command line application developed to make some queries on the dabase using the neo4j python drivers.
I have also submitted a GraphGist showing the model developed. A copy of the raw AsciiDoc used to make the GraphGist can also be found here.
